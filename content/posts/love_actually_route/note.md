There are certain films that you just feel like rewatching as Christmas approaches. My favourite is Love Actually, and this year, I decided to find the locations from the film and turn them into a walking tour.

The tour begins at the Oxo Tower, where Mark showed Juliet his video of her. You can even retrace Mark’s steps from his home to the riverside.

Not far from there is the bench where Daniel had a heart-to-heart with his son. You’ll find it opposite the Paradiso restaurant (56 Upper Ground).

The next stop is a bit farther away: the chapel where Juliet and Peter’s wedding took place. The chapel is called Grosvenor Chapel. On your way there, you’ll cross the stunning Golden Jubilee Bridges, see the festive market at Trafalgar Square, and walk down one of London’s most beautifully decorated streets, New Bond Street.

The final stop is 27 St Luke’s Mews. If you still have energy, you can walk there, but I’d recommend taking the tube at this point. Once there, you can take some photos of this charming location and enjoy a stroll through Notting Hill.
