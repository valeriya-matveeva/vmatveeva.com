If you're in London, I have a small quest for you and your friends or your boyfriend or girlfriend. It serves as a fun lead-in to an awesome gaming venue like [FairGame](https://www.wearefairgame.com/). Of course, simply visiting FairGame is already exciting, but turning the journey there into a game makes it several times more thrilling.

To get an idea of how it works, you can check out a video in my reels, for example, on Instagram.

Here's how the quest is organized:

 - You've decided to surprise your boyfriend or girlfriend and ask them to find a QR code that you've hidden somewhere.

 - Once they find the QR code and open the bot, they'll receive their first task: to head to Canary Wharf and find "Big Boy." However, the message will hint that there's a missing letter in the word "Boy." The correct answer is "Big Buoy," which they’ll need to locate on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/riHpFuoxJHg9uWSP9) and walk to.

 - When your partner reaches Big Buoy, they'll need to send their location. If it's correct (meaning they are indeed near Big Buoy), they'll receive a message instructing them to look across the river—there, they'll see their final destination: FairGame!
