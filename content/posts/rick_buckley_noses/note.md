Route map at the end of the article!

Rick Buckley was born in 1962 in Essex, United Kingdom. He studied at the Düsseldorf Art Academy in Germany. Buckley is best known for his protest against the installation of surveillance cameras. As part of this protest, he placed small sculptures of noses on the streets of London.

Originally, around 1997, approximately 30–35 noses were installed, but I managed to find only six. It is known that the seventh nose is located on Admiralty Arch. However, as of late 2024, the arch is under restoration. Although the nose is currently not visible, I suggest starting the route from this location.

Google Maps estimates the walk to take about 40 minutes, but considering stops for photos and sightseeing, it will likely take about an hour. Additionally, the streets along this route are beautiful and perfect for getting to know London.

**The Route:**

1. The first nose can be found on Endell Street (DC Beauty).

3. The third and fourth noses are very close to each other on Dean Street (29 and 30 buildings on Dean street).
