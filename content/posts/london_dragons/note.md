What to see in London? Which walking route to choose?
If you’re looking for something beyond the usual stroll along the Thames, why not try a unique route through the City of London, where you can discover almost all of its dragons? 

In addition to the dragons, you’ll enjoy the beauty of London’s streets, featuring a mix of historic and modern buildings. For instance, you’ll pass by Barbican, a brutalist architectural masterpiece near the dragon on Goswell Street. Then you’ll see The Charterhouse, a medieval monastery, and stroll past Smithfield Market, which, according to rumors, has been around for almost 800 years.

The City of London is a unique place, often regarded as the starting point of London’s history. One of its most recognizable symbols is the dragon, which adorns the coat of arms and guards the city’s borders.

The origins of these dragons remain unclear. Some believe they are connected to the legend of St. George and the Dragon, as St. George is the patron saint of England. Dragons are also central figures in English folklore, from ancient Anglo-Saxon mythological tales such as Beowulf.
