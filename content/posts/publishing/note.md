X-Slug: publishing

Maybe you think it is easy, but I didn't find it fast. It is very important step before a publish. It helps to check wrongs and get approval in future.

When you add a wearable, you can see a button "See in world".

After clicking, you will have a mistake.

To fix the mistake, you need to change the network in a Metamask. Click on the button "Add network".
