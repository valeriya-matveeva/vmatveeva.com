If you are one of those who have dreamed of receiving a letter from Hogwarts, boarding the train from Platform 9¾, and diving into the magical world of Harry Potter, then this walking tour in London is for you!

1. Leadenhall Market
Film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
Leadenhall Market is one of the most atmospheric locations in the film. Its unique Victorian architecture perfectly suits the magical world. The entrance to the Leaky Cauldron, through which Harry first enters Diagon Alley, is located here.

2. Millennium Bridge
Film: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
This modern pedestrian bridge falls victim to dark forces at the very beginning of the sixth film. A walk across the Millennium Bridge will not only let you relive the dramatic destruction scene but also allow you to enjoy stunning views of the Thames and St. Paul’s Cathedral.

3. Australia House
Film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
The interiors of the magical Gringotts Bank were filmed right here, in the building of Australia House.

4. St Pancras Clock Tower
Film: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
This iconic tower appears in the scene where Harry and Ron, in the flying car, try to get to Hogwarts. The clock tower is a recognizable feature of London’s skyline and one you’ll spot immediately.

5. King’s Cross Station, Platform 9¾
Films: Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
This is perhaps the most iconic location for all Harry Potter fans. At King’s Cross Station, you’ll find a special spot with a trolley “disappearing into the wall” and a souvenir shop where you can purchase magical merchandise.

On the way from Australia House to St Pancras Clock Tower at King’s Cross Station, Platform 9¾, I highly recommend stopping by Ana’s Deli and Cafe to enjoy some excellent coffee and delightful Bugatsa (not an ad).
