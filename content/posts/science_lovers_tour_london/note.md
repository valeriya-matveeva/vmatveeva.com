**The route on Google Maps is at the end of the article.**

London is not only a city with a rich history but also a place where great minds lived and worked, changing the world forever. If you love science and want to explore its history, we offer you an exciting walking route through London. In just a few hours (the route with a lunch stop may take about 3-4 hours, or about 2.5 hours without stops), you can visit the houses where famous scientists lived.

**First Stop: Isaac Newton's House**

Address: 87 Jermyn Street

We begin our journey with the house where Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists in history, once lived. Newton made an incredible contribution to physics, mathematics, and astronomy. His law of universal gravitation and three laws of motion became the foundation of modern mechanics. Here, on Jermyn Street, he lived from 1642 to 1727. While walking around this area, imagine the great scientist pondering the mysteries of the universe.

**Second Stop: Michael Faraday's House**

Address: 48 Blandford Street

The next stop on the route is Michael Faraday's house. Faraday, the son of a blacksmith, became one of the most influential scientists of the 19th century. His research in electromagnetism and electrolysis laid the groundwork for modern physics. Thanks to his discoveries, we use electric generators today.

**Delicious Break: Como Garden Restaurant**

Address: 37-45 Kensington High Street

After two inspiring stops, we suggest taking a short break to enjoy lunch at the Italian restaurant Como Garden. This cozy spot is famous for its truffle mushroom pasta an exquisite dish that will recharge you for the next part of your walk (not an advertisement, based on my personal experience).

**Third Stop: James Maxwell's House**

Address: 16 Palace Gardens Terrace

After lunch, head to the house of James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell was a scientist who united electricity, magnetism, and light into one theory. His equations describing the electromagnetic field became the foundation for many modern technologies, from radio to the internet.

**Final Stop: Alan Turing's House**

Address: 2 Warrington Cres

Finish your route at the house of Alan Turing, an outstanding mathematician and cryptographer. Turing played a key role in decoding German military messages during World War II, which helped the Allies win. He is also considered the founder of modern computer science and artificial intelligence. The house on Warrington Crescent preserves the memory of this remarkable scientist.
