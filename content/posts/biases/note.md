In our previous video (https://youtu.be/L9nGqj0csCU), we discussed the Availability Heuristic and how our consciousness's reliance on external information can hinder accurate statistical predictions. Today, we delve into the fascinating world of attention-related biases.

Hello, I'm Lera, and in this article, we will explore Attentional Bias, Affect Heuristic, and the Focusing Effect. We will understand the significance of these biases and how they can be applied in practical situations.

Attentional Bias:
Attentional bias occurs when we pay more attention to thoughts or information that are repetitive, influencing our perception. Often, we tend to notice what we have previously encountered or remembered and overlook other options.

For instance, when contemplating a job change, we become more sensitive to our colleagues' shortcomings and the company's flaws, while the accurate metrics and quality services of the company may go unnoticed.

A Personal Example:
Allow me to share a personal example. Recently, I developed an interest in retro gaming. While scrolling through my Instagram feed, I stumbled upon advertisements for Pacman-themed t-shirts. Even though I wasn't actively searching for clothing, I found myself fixated on those t-shirts. This is a clear example of attentional bias.

Emotions and the Affect Heuristic:
Attentional bias often intertwines with our emotions. For example, I want to quit  my work because my colleagues are pissing me off or I play old games because I enjoy it. Speaking about emotion I want to move to the next bias as Affect Heuristic.

The Affect Heuristic refers to our tendency to make decisions based on emotions rather than careful, systematic thinking. Emotions play a significant role in guiding our actions.

For example, when choosing stocks to invest in, people often pay attention to how much they like the company, instead of evaluating stocks in terms of their investment attractiveness.

The Importance of Shared Values:
At this point, I would like to highlight the significance of understanding the affect heuristic in marketing. To effectively promote a product, it is crucial to identify your customers' values and demonstrate shared values. This connection can evoke a powerful emotional response, leading to stronger customer engagement.

A notable example is the brand Dove, known for its soap and body care products. When you visit their website, you won't find an abundance of product ads. Instead, they focus on issues like the impact of social media on children, virtual reality as an approach to show natural beauty experiences, and fighting against animal testing. By aligning themselves with customers' values, Dove has built a strong bond with their audience, and many people choose their products because of this shared connection, even when faced with comparable alternatives.

The Focusing Effect:
Moving on to another bias related to attention, we encounter the Focusing Effect. We have already established that our attention is drawn more to things that align with our thoughts. However, the Focusing Effect goes a step further, as it amplifies the significance of certain aspects while downplaying others.

For example, while browsing the grocery store shelves, we may pay more attention to low-calorie products and overlook the small print that reveals the presence of chemicals. This bias can impact decision-making by creating a laser focus on one particular aspect.

Leveraging the Focusing Effect:
As marketers, we can utilize the Focusing Effect to our advantage by emphasizing the main advantages or unique selling points of a product. By highlighting these aspects, we can capture the consumer's attention and influence their decision-making process.

In conclusion, let's recap how cognitive biases can be applied in real-life situations:

Attentional Bias: Recognize the importance of understanding what your target audience is currently focused on, as their thoughts and interests can greatly impact their perception and decision-making.

Affect Heuristic: Connect with your customers on an emotional level by aligning your brand values with theirs. Demonstrating shared values can have a profound impact on their decision to engage with your brand.

The Focusing Effect: Highlight the key advantages of your product or service. By directing their attention to these specific aspects, you can influence their decision-making process.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you found this interesting. Until next time!
